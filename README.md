# CarRentalSystemCpp
Every one of us is grateful for car rental systems like Ola and Uber.

Such apps have made our life more effortless. There is no speck of doubt that these systems are performing great on their end, but these apps ought to have some more up-gradations. Improving and modifying those apps with the exact principle, and employing top-level codons can be an excellent C++ project that can guide you to learn many new things for sure. You can make use of Format text files in C++ to accumulate Cab and the customerâ€™s GPS coordinate within a certain radius.

In this code, we have two main classes: Car and CarRentalSystem. The Car class represents a single car with its attributes like make, model, license plate, latitude, and longitude. The CarRentalSystem class represents the car rental system and includes functionalities like adding cars, displaying available cars, and finding cars within a certain radius based on GPS coordinates.

The readCarDataFromFile function reads car data from a text file and populates the car rental system. The car data is expected to be in the format of space-separated values: make, model, license plate, latitude, and longitude.

The main function demonstrates the usage of the car rental system. It reads car data from a file, displays available cars, and finds cars within a certain radius using the given latitude, longitude, and radius values.

Please note that you will need to create a text file named "car_data.txt" and populate it with car data in the specified format before running the program.
